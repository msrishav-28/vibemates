# Vibemates - Expo Cleanup Summary

This document outlines the changes made to convert your React Native CLI project to a clean Expo-only setup for iOS development of Vibemates.

## Files and Folders Removed

### 1. iOS Native Project
- **Removed**: `ios/` folder (entire directory)
- **Reason**: Expo manages the native iOS build process, so the manually configured iOS project is no longer needed

### 2. React Native CLI Configuration
- **Removed**: `react-native.config.js`
- **Reason**: This configuration file is specific to React Native CLI and not used by Expo

## Configuration Updates

### 1. Package.json Changes
- **Updated Scripts**:
  - Removed: `android`, `web`, `eject`, `start:dev-client`, `start:metro`, `build:ios`, `build:android`, `pod-install`, `clean:ios`, `reset-cache`
  - Kept: `start`, `ios`, `test`, `lint`, `clean`
  - **Reason**: Simplified to Expo-only commands for iOS development

- **Added Dependencies**:
  - Added: `jest-expo` for proper Expo testing setup
  - **Reason**: Better integration with Expo's testing environment

- **Updated Jest Configuration**:
  - Changed preset from `react-native` to `jest-expo`
  - Removed unnecessary module file extensions config
  - **Reason**: Expo provides a more optimized Jest configuration

### 2. App.json Changes
- **Removed Android Configuration**:
  - Removed entire `android` block including adaptive icon, package name, version code, and permissions
  - **Reason**: Focusing only on iOS development

- **Removed Web Configuration**:
  - Removed `web` block with favicon and bundler settings
  - **Reason**: Not needed for iOS-only development

### 3. README.md Updates
- Updated description to indicate iOS-focused development
- Updated installation and running instructions for Expo CLI
- Added proper iOS-specific setup steps
- Updated tech stack to reflect Expo-first approach

## What Remains (Preserved Functionality)

### Core App Files
- `App.tsx` - Main app component (already Expo-compatible)
- `index.js` - Entry point using `registerRootComponent` (Expo standard)
- All source code in `src/` folder
- All assets in `assets/` folder

### Configuration Files
- `app.json` - Expo configuration (cleaned up for iOS-only)
- `babel.config.js` - Babel configuration with path aliases (Expo-compatible)
- `metro.config.js` - Metro bundler configuration (using Expo's getDefaultConfig)
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `package.json` - Cleaned up dependencies and scripts

### Dependencies
All your existing dependencies remain functional:
- React Navigation
- Zustand state management
- React Native Maps
- Expo Location
- React Native Vector Icons
- All TypeScript types and linting setup

## How to Run Your App Now

1. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Run on iOS Simulator**:
   ```bash
   npm run ios
   ```

3. **Test on Physical Device**:
   - Scan QR code with Expo Go app
   - Or use development build when ready for production

## Benefits of This Cleanup

1. **Simplified Development**: No need to manage native iOS project
2. **Easier CI/CD**: Expo build service handles iOS builds
3. **Faster Setup**: New developers don't need Xcode project setup
4. **Consistent Environment**: Expo provides standardized React Native environment
5. **OTA Updates**: Ability to push updates without App Store review (for JS/CSS changes)
6. **Reduced Complexity**: Less configuration files and build scripts to maintain

## Next Steps

1. Test your app with `npm start` and `npm run ios`
2. When ready for production, use Expo Build Service (EAS Build)
3. Consider setting up EAS for automated builds and deployments
4. Use Expo Dev Client for any native modules not included in Expo Go

Your app functionality remains exactly the same, but now with a much cleaner and more maintainable Expo-focused setup!
